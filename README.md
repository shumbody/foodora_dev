===========
Foodora, which means food hour in broken-Italian, was built by Andrew Shum in 2010 for the annual 6.470 web programming competition at MIT. The original concept of Foodora was a food recommender tool that could learn the user's taste preferences as the user provided feedback in the form of likes and dislikes. Foods are labeled with various culinary-related features. So as Foodora learns, a taste model is generated that embodies information about the user's preferences for different cuisines, ingredients, and meal types.
